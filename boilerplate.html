		<p class="justify"> Hello, everyone my name is <span class="bluetext"> Carlissa </span>. I am 19 years old and I'm from Georgia. This is a list of my favorite activities: </p>

				For dance, the Barnard Dance department has been very accessible to non-majors. I took ballet and modern. Sadly though, I got a knee injury last semester, so I couldn't continue with technique classes. Instead, I've been taking Pilates which so far has been really enjoyable and helpful for finding alignment.

				 As for knitting, I'm in the club "Gosh Yarn It" which is a student organization for knitters and crocheters. Though I haven't been to many meetings, the people there are very interesting and I'm looking forward to hanging out with them more. </p>

				In respect to books, I'm probably taking one too many English classes but all in all I'm very happy with the texts we're discussing. Also I love going to used bookstores like the Strand and whenever I finally dig myself out of the pile of homework I'm in, I have a nice little niche of books on my desk awaiting me. </p>
