		<h1> My Passion Project </h1>
		<p> Hello, everyone my name is Carlissa and I'm from Georgia. This is a list of my favorite things: 
			<ol>
				<li> Dance <br> <img src="firstposition.jpg"> </br> <p> <br> Thankfully, I can find all of my interests here in the Columbia community. For dance, the Barnard Dance department is very accessible to non-majors. I got a mild knee injury last semester so I couldn't continue with ballet this year. But I was able to take pilates this semester which so far has been really enjoyable and helpful. </br>  </p> </li>

				<li> Knitting <br> <img src="knitheart.jpg"> </br> 
				<p> <br> As for knitting, I'm in the club "Gosh Yarn It" which is a student organization for knitters and crocheters. Though I haven't been to many meetings, the people there are very interesting and I'm looking forward to hanging out with them more.</br> </p> </li> 

				<li> Books <br> <img src="bookpile.png"> </br> 
				<p> <br>In respect to books, I'm probably taking one too many English classes but all in all I'm very happy with the texts we're discussing. ALso I love going to used bookstores like the Strand and whenever I finally dig myself out of the pile of homework I'm in, I have a nice little niche of books on my desk awaiting me.</br> </p> </li>
			</ol>
